This game is designed in a way that its played between two users 1st user is you and second is computer itself... it is inspired from Rock, Paper and scissor.
It is designed using C language in which 5 chances are there each chance takes 0, 1, 2 as input and compared to rock paper scissor instead of rock, paper ,scissor here is Dragon, Water, Bomb respectively...
If the user chooses Dragon and the computer chooses Water, the Dragon wins because the Dragon drinks the Water.
If the user chooses Dragon and the computer chooses Bomb, the Bomb wins because the Bomb destroys the Dragon.
If the user chooses Water and the computer chooses Bomb, the Water wins because the Water drowns the Bomb.
The player who wins 3 out of 5 rounds will be declared the ultimate winner...
